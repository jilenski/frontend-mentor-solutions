## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS pre-processor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Upon doing this project I learned how to convert a design to HTML markup and style using CSS custom properties.
- I am also using SASS pre-processor to custom CSS.
- I learned how it is easy to custom CSS by doing Mobile-first workflow.
- The design is simple and beginner-friendly and suitable for familiarizing myself with coding web components.
- I learned how to manipulate component content or state using Vanilla JavaScript.

### Continued development

- I am planning to add transition effects upon submitting and displaying the acknoledgement message.
- I am currently studying React for frontend development so after this I am planning to convert every component design with React framework.
