## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I have a free-subscription so before I started to make the code I first convert the .jpg designs to Figma design.
  By doing this, I was able to code the stylesheet easily.
- Upon doing this project I learned how to convert a design to HTML markup and style using CSS custom properties.
- The design is simple and beginner-friendly and suitable for familiarizing myself with coding web components.

### Continued development

- I am currently studying React for frontend development so after this I am planning to convert every component design with React framework.

### Useful resources

- [AI Bard](https://bard.google.com/) - This is my companion throughout my web development journey.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This website always helps me with the design. It has all the basics of CSS Styling.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This website is a great source of tool for making designs. It also helps me with the CSS Codes and gives me an idea on how to make a custom CSS properties.
