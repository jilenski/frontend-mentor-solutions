## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS pre-processor
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Upon doing this project I learned how to convert a design to HTML markup and style using CSS custom properties.
- I am also using SASS pre-processor to custom CSS.
- I learned how it is easy to custom CSS by doing Mobile-first workflow.
- The design is simple and beginner-friendly and suitable for familiarizing myself with coding a landing page.

### Continued development

- I am currently studying React for frontend development so after this I am planning to convert every component design with React framework.
