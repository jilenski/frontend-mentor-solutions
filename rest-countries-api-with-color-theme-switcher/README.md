## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS pre-processor | 7-1 architecture
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6 Modules

### What I learned

- Through this project, I gained skills in converting designs to HTML using CSS custom properties.
- Additionally, I employed the SASS pre-processor for CSS customization, adopting a Mobile-first workflow for easy styling.
- Organizing my SASS modules using the SASS 7-1 architecture enhanced readability.
- Furthermore, I acquired proficiency in utilizing APIs to populate HTML content,
- Implementing JavaScript to enable data search and content filtering through input fields.
- Fetching data from an API allowed me to create dynamic detail pages for each country.
- I also mastered the ability to set themes based on system preferences, manipulate themes according to user choices, store preferences in localStorage, and apply them consistently across all pages.
- Bonus, I also learned how to randomly render cards instead of loading it based on the given API indexes.
- The design, being simple and beginner-friendly, served as a valuable exercise for coding a landing page.

### Continued development

- I am currently studying React for frontend development so after this I am planning to convert every component design with React framework or any other JavaScript framework.
