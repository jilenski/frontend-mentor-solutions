## Overview

### The challenge

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS pre-processor | 7-1 architecture
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6 Modules

### What I learned

- Through this project, I gained skills in converting designs to HTML using CSS custom properties.
- Additionally, I employed the SASS pre-processor for CSS customization, adopting a Mobile-first workflow for easy styling.
- Organizing my SASS modules using the SASS 7-1 architecture enhanced readability.
- Using JavaScript, I learned how to validate input to meet certain conditions.
- The design, being simple and beginner-friendly, served as a valuable exercise for coding a landing page.

### Continued development

- I am currently studying React for frontend development so after this I am planning to convert every component design with React framework or any other JavaScript framework.
